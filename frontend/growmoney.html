                <h2>How Your Money Can Grow</h2>
                <p>Making regular payments to yourself, even in small amounts, can add up over time. The amount your money grows
                    depends on the interest earned and the amount of time you leave it in the account.</p>
                <p>Interest is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An amount of money banks or other financial institutions pay you for keeping money on deposit with them</li>
                    <li>Expressed as a percentage</li>
                    <li>Calculated based on the amount of money in your account</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Annual versus Daily Compounding</h3>
                <p>Compounding is how your money can grow when you keep it in a financial institution that pays interest.</p>
                <p>When a financial institution compounds the interest in your account, you earn money on the previously paid
                    interest, in addition to the money in your account.</p>
                <p>Not all savings accounts are created equal. This is because interest can be compounded daily, monthly, or
                    annually.</p>
